# The Vision

This page describes the main principles that drive the development of `probatus` as well as the general directions, in which the development of the package will be heading.

## The Purpose

`probatus` has started as a side project of Data Scientists at ING Bank. 
It consists of tools that help in analysing binary classification models and the data used to develop them.
This includes the analysis steps that one may perform at any step of building the model, from data exploration, through 
interpreting the model, to indicating the stability of the results. 
We have decided to open-source it, in order to share the tools and enable collaboration with the Data Science community.

Our main goals are:

- Continue maintaining the tools that we have built, and make sure that they are well documented and tested
- Continuously extend functionality available in the package
- Build a community of users, which use the package in day-to-day work and learn from each other, while contributing to probatus

## The Principles

The main principles that drive development of `probatus` are the following

- Usefulness - any tool that we build should be useful for a broad range of users,
- Simplicity - simple to understand and analyse steps over state-of-the-art,
- Usability - the developed functionality must be have good documentation, consistent API and work flawlessly with scikit-learn compatible models,
- Reliability - the code that is available for the users should be well tested and reliable, and bugs should be fixed as soon as they are detected.

## The Roadmap

The following [issue](https://github.com/ing-bank/probatus/issues/93) keeps track of the features coming to probatus.
We are open to new ideas, so if you can think of a feature that fits the vision, make an [issue](https://github.com/ing-bank/probatus/issues) and help us further develop this package.
